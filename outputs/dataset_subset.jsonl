The best thing to do is to speak early on to your school's IT department or the people who look after the school website.\nYou need to create a dedicated School Report web page on the school website so that people can find the students' work.

It saves a lot of hassle in the busy run-up to News Day when you and the School Reporters would probably rather be focusing on getting great interviews than sorting out technical issues.\nAs soon as your page is ready, the School Report team can link to your website from the map of participating schools. - as long as both pieces of School Report paperwork have been returned!\nOnce live, some schools use the page to reflect what's happening in the build-up to the News Day, for example adding team photos and encouraging pupils to post news reporting ideas.\nNo. It is important to create a dedicated web page, so the BBC can link directly to the students' journalistic work. The fewer the clicks, the more likely you are to retain the audience.\nAlso, after the News Day, the homepage of a school website will inevitably change, but creating a dedicated page means there is a permanent record of their work.\nYes. If your school has participated in School Report in previous years, you can use the existing web page, but remember to label it clearly.\nRemember, you risk losing people's attention if they think your web page is out of date. A simple message at the top of the page can be helpful, such as the example mentioned above.\nIf you can't publish School Report content on your school website, all is not lost!\nYou could look at hosting stories on another website that you consider appropriate and that is in line with your school's policy. See if your local council or academy sponsor could help host your content.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nYou could create a web page using a number of different programmes, with many people using software such as Microsoft Expression or Adobe Dreamweaver.\nIf you do use a site other than your school site, check the terms and conditions to make sure it is suitable for 11 to 16-year-olds and that there are no advertisements on the site.\nThe golden rule is to use first names only. For child protection reasons, the BBC cannot link to a page which contains the surnames of anyone younger than 18.

However, they can only be used by schools who have completed their paperwork, and within the context of the project.\nIt is also a good idea to incorporate the design of your school website to create a uniform look.\nIt is best to avoid a design which relies on large pictures as it will make pages slow to download and could put off potential viewers. However, you might like to add photographs of students taking part in School Report or the school logo.\nOur agreement with the head teacher of every school taking part explicitly states that the school, not the BBC, is responsible for the school website.

How we respond will determine the impact on jobs and growth.\n\"We must provide fiscal credibility, continuing to be tough on the deficit while being realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade.\"\nLabour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move, saying: \"Sadly the vote last Thursday for Brexit has only brought forward what was inevitable.\n\"The Chancellor had already dropped his other fiscal rules on welfare and debt at the Budget in March, and according to many economists he was expected to be forced to drop this one too.\"\nBBC business editor Kamal Ahmed says that the target was heading for the \"Treasury shredding machine\" following a speech from Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday.\nIn a speech launching her bid to become prime minister she said \"we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament\".\nKamal says that Mr Osborne has now followed suit.\nNevertheless, the Treasury insists that it still wants to balance the books and \"fix the finances\".\nMr Osborne first committed himself to returning the national finances to surplus by 2020 at the Conservative Party conference in 2013 and it became policy in the July budget of 2015.\nBut there have been questions ever since over whether that target could be met.\nEven before the referendum vote he only had \"a slightly better than 50/50 chance\" of making the target said Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nBut the uncertainty caused by the Leave vote could hold back the economy and make creating a surplus even more difficult.\n\"Having voted for Brexit last week, the economy is clearly going to go into a downswing, that might be a full-blown recession, that might just be very very low growth,\" said Paul Johnson the director of the IFS.\nIt is sometimes easy in these incredible political times to forget that for most people \"it's the economy, stupid\" still holds true.\nFor the UK economy, one of the most important passages of Theresa May's speech yesterday was when she signalled that George Osborne's \"fiscal rule\" (to produce a budget surplus by 2020) was for the Treasury shredding machine.\n\"While it is absolutely vital that the government continues with its intention to reduce public spending and cut the budget deficit, we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament,\" Mrs May said.\nNow the chancellor has said he agrees, arguing that the government must be \"realistic\" about its fiscal targets and that austerity policies could be eased.\nMy Treasury sources point out that the \"rule\" can be varied in \"non-normal\" times.\nAnd these are pretty \"non-normal\" times.\nThe abandonment of the fiscal target suggests the government could borrow more, presumably for investment in infrastructure and to mitigate the need for tax rises and spending cuts, if the economy does take a turn for the worse as some predict.\nMore from Kamal: Brexit and the easing of austerity\nThe Tories have been in turmoil since David Cameron announced his intention to resign following the UK's vote in favour on leaving the European Union.\nIn a shock development on Thursday, Boris Johnson, widely seen as the frontrunner to become prime minister, announced that he would not be running.\nThe BBC has learned that Justice Secretary Michael Gove is now coming under growing pressure to abandon his bid to become Tory leader.\nSources have told the BBC government ministers are trying to persuade the justice secretary to give way so the party can \"unite\" around Home Secretary Theresa May.\nMr Gove opted to stand after switching his support from Boris Johnson.\nIn a speech, Mr Gove said his decision to stand to become Conservative leader is driven by \"conviction\" about what is right for the UK not personal ambition.\nThree other candidates have put their names forward for the Conservative leadership: Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, MP Liam Fox and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb.\nThe government borrowed Â£74.9bn in the 2015/2016 fiscal year and for the financial year so far - covering April and May - borrowing reached Â£17.9bn, Â£0.2bn higher than the same period a year ago.\nIt is thought that the government will now raise borrowing, so it can avoid further cuts in spending or raising taxes. It could also borrow to invest in big building projects.\n\"The problem of course is, you can't borrow forever,\"said Paul Johnson from the IFS.\n\"So we'll have a few more years of more borrowing, but my guess is this is not the end of austerity, actually this means austerity will just go on for longer because we'll probably have the spending cuts and tax rises right through the 2020s to pay for this.\"", "reference": "Chancellor George Osborne has abandoned his target to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020."}

The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.\nA few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.\nCarrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.\nEyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.\nFaizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.\n\"I knew he was gone,\" Zarifa told me.\nA heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.\nFaizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest \"martyr\". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.\nFaizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.\nThe voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.\nThe soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with \"protests and provocation\" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.\nOne report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.\nSeparatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the \"anti-people\" agenda of the Indian government.\nDisillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.\nWhy Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.\nBy all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.\nWhatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.\nA picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - \"he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,\" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.\n\"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,\" a cousin told me, when I visited the family.\nGrief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.\n\"My son, my son, where will I find you now?\" she cried, again and again.\nThen she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.\n\"The blood of a martyr never goes waste,\" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. \"One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].\"\nA brief silence followed.

Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.\"\nOutside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.\nThey said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because \"they are our brothers and don't kill civilians\" and are \"fighting for freedom\".\nMore than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.\n\"We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,\" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.\nSince February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.\nThe army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.\nRecently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.\n\"Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,\" an army officer told me.\nThe region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.\nKashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.\nMany say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.\nMilitancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.\nBut young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of \"becoming irrelevant\", as a leader of an opposition party told me.\n\"This is the worst situation that I have seen.
