34363226,"Sarah Johnson was one of 21 women heading to Liverpool when their minibus was hit by a lorry on the M62.
Her friend Bethany Jones, 18, was killed while Ms Johnson and several others were badly hurt.
Minibus driver James Johnson was jailed for more than six years for causing Bethany's death, in April 2013.
Ms Johnson, who broke her shoulder, back and pelvis, said the help she received from a charity while in hospital led her to want to support others.
Speaking publicly for the first time about the crash, Ms Johnson described how everyone was ""excited and giddy"" for the hen party.
""To me the impact was just a massive explosion,"" she said.  ""I thought the bus had blown up.
""I remember the bus dropping on its side. The next thing, I woke up on the roadside so I'd actually come out of the window.""
Ms Johnson was taken to Leeds General Infirmary where she, along with Bethany's sister Amy Firth, underwent major surgery and spent time in intensive care.
Whilst she was there she got support from charity Day One, which helps victims of major trauma.
She said: ""It's absolutely fantastic.
""It supports people by giving benefit advice, legal advice and peer support such as me and Amy, who have been in similar situations and who are now helping other people who've suffered from major trauma.""
Ms Johnson said the crash had made her realise how lucky she had been.
""Beth can't complain, she's not here,"" she added.

But Strachan did not wish to consider what a defeat would mean for his own future and said: ""Whatever happens after that, we will look at that.""
The 60-year-old, who has been in charge since 2013, signed a new two-year contract in October 2015.
Following successive 3-0 defeats away to Slovakia and England, he took time to consider his position but decided in November to carry on after receiving the backing of the Scottish Football Association board.
As he announced his squad for the 22 March warm-up friendly against Canada, followed by the qualifier against Slovenia, Strachan underlined his belief that the Scots could still reach the 2018 finals in Russia.
""If we win that game, we will only be one point behind Slovenia, who are in second at the moment,"" he said.
Strachan, whose side lie fifth with four points from four matches, insisted he had ""no idea"" how many points they might require from their final six matches to qualify, while admitting that the Scots could not afford further setbacks.

Appeal judges also agreed that a jury was misdirected over charges relating to the footage sent to relatives.
Mr Weatherhogg, 43, was jailed last May after being found guilty by a jury.
It is understood he will now be released from prison.
Sheriff George Way had remitted the case from Dundee Sheriff Court to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because of its greater sentencing powers.
Defence counsel Shelagh McCall QC told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that the Crown conceded there was insufficient evidence to prove lack of consent on the coercion charge.
The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, who heard the appeal with Lady Paton and Lord Turnbull, said: ""We are satisfied the concession is well made.""
Lord Turnbull said that information conveyed to the court seemed to show that even at an earlier preparatory marking stage in the case there were concerns over a lack of corroboration.
Lady Dorrian said the appeal judges were also satisfied that misdirections given to jurors by Sheriff Way over the charges relating to the footage sent to relatives were ""material and constituted a miscarriage of justice"".
Mr Weatherhogg, of Guthrie, near Forfar, Angus, had denied the charges during the trial, but admitted a separate charge of uploading the film to the internet.
He was jailed for four-and-years by Lady Wolffe with an additional 18 months for the charge he admitted.
The appeal hearing was told that Mr Weatherhogg had been in custody since March last year and had served the 18 month sentence, taking into account early release provisions.","A man jailed for six years for coercing a woman into having sex with a stranger and sending ""revenge porn"" to her family has had the convictions quashed.",Clive Weatherhogg's counsel told appeal judges that prosecutors now conceded there had been a miscarriage of justice over the coercion charge.,"Clive Weatherhogg's counsel told appeal judges that prosecutors now conceded there had been a miscarriage of justice over the coercion charge.Appeal judges also agreed that a jury was misdirected over charges relating to the footage sent to relatives.The case was referred to the Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh on Tuesday.Mr Weatherhog, 43, was jailed last May after being found guilty by a jury.It is understood he will now be released from prison.The Crown had argued that the Crown had failed to prove lack of consent.Sheriff George Way had remitted the case from Dundee Sheriff Court to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because of its greater sentencing powers.The appeal was heard on Tuesday afternoon.Defence counsel Shelagh McCall QC told the Court of Justice Appeal on the Crown conceded there was insufficient evidence to prove absence of consent on the coercion claim.The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, who heard the appeal with Lady Paton and Lord Turnbull, said: ""We are satisfied the concession is well made.""Lord Turnbull said that information conveyed to the court seemed to show that even at an earlier preparatory marking stage in the case there were concussions between the Crown and the defence."

The Abergele inquest is examining if a Hotpoint dryer caused the fire.
On Thursday, a fire engineer told the hearing there was ""no compelling evidence"" it started in the dryer but he could not rule it out.
Clifford Christie, a member of the Institute of Fire Engineers, was asked to look into the cause of the fire by domestic appliance company Whirlpool.
Giving evidence on the second day of the hearing, he said the dryer was ""severely damaged"" by fire but some components on the machine were intact.
Mr Christie said he was ""satisfied"" it had not started in the timer, the motor or the drum, and there was no accumulation of lint in the machine.
But he said he could not rule out that it started in the machine's starter switch, which was not recovered following the blaze.
He also told the hearing it was possible there was a fault in an iron kept in the same room.
He said evidence given to the inquest on Wednesday that the iron was switched off might have been ""mistaken"".
On Wednesday, a tenant who lived in the flat spoke of surviving the fire.
Garry Lloyd Jones, 50, told the inquest: ""I just remember walking down the corridor to see what was going on and seeing flames coming out of the tumble dryer.
""I went down to the living area and went to the kitchen and there was nothing there but when I looked out of the kitchen window I could see an orange glow.""

39950399,"According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend.
More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days.
Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal.
This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data.
One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest.
""Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions,"" wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity.
Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites.
He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic.
""It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates,"" he said.
He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway.
For example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time.
And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added.
Other watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days.
Earlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system.
This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website.
""Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something,"" noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute.
He cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality.
""This is how people protest these days,"" said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments.
He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it.
However, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist.
""There are people that care about this issue a lot,"" he told the BBC.
""Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'""
The FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.","Bots appear to be spamming a US regulator's website over a proposed reversal of net neutrality rules, researchers have said.","According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend.","According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend.More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anti-Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal.This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data.One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest.""Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions,"" wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity.""It really seems like this is something that's been going on for a long time.""Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sashok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites.He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic.""This is something we should be very careful about,"" he said.

If you're not technically minded, don't worry! The best thing to do is to speak early on to your school's IT department or the people who look after the school website.
You need to create a dedicated School Report web page on the school website so that people can find the students' work. It has to be accessible to the public, so don't use internal websites (or intranets) or pages that need a password.
Until your pupils' reports are ready, the page should contain a ""holding"" or ""come back later"" message. You can copy and paste this:
Students from this school will be making the news for real on 16 March 2017 as they take part in BBC News School Report. We aim to publish the news by 1600 GMT on News Day, so please save this page as a favourite and return to it later.
Have a click through to examples from our School Report map if you want an idea of how other schools have gone about it.
Once the page is live, email the web address (URL) to the School Report team via schoolreport@bbc.co.uk so we can link to your webpage.
As soon as possible! It saves a lot of hassle in the busy run-up to News Day when you and the School Reporters would probably rather be focusing on getting great interviews than sorting out technical issues.
As soon as your page is ready, the School Report team can link to your website from the map of participating schools. - as long as both pieces of School Report paperwork have been returned!
Once live, some schools use the page to reflect what's happening in the build-up to the News Day, for example adding team photos and encouraging pupils to post news reporting ideas.
No. It is important to create a dedicated web page, so the BBC can link directly to the students' journalistic work. The fewer the clicks, the more likely you are to retain the audience.
Also, after the News Day, the homepage of a school website will inevitably change, but creating a dedicated page means there is a permanent record of their work.
Yes. If your school has participated in School Report in previous years, you can use the existing web page, but remember to label it clearly.
Remember, you risk losing people's attention if they think your web page is out of date. A simple message at the top of the page can be helpful, such as the example mentioned above.
If you can't publish School Report content on your school website, all is not lost!
You could look at hosting stories on another website that you consider appropriate and that is in line with your school's policy. See if your local council or academy sponsor could help host your content.
Some schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.
You could create a web page using a number of different programmes, with many people using software such as Microsoft Expression or Adobe Dreamweaver.
If you do use a site other than your school site, check the terms and conditions to make sure it is suitable for 11 to 16-year-olds and that there are no advertisements on the site.
The golden rule is to use first names only. For child protection reasons, the BBC cannot link to a page which contains the surnames of anyone younger than 18. This also applies to blog entries and comments posted on the page.
Refer to the School Report guidelines on staying safe and legal which highlight some of the issues anyone should consider when publishing content which features children. This page also offers guidance about media law issues such as copyright, libel and contempt of court as well as editorial issues such as taste and decency.
Be aware that the BBC website is very popular. By virtue of a link from the BBC, students will have a large audience but people will also be able to access other pages on the school website.
At the bottom of this page, there are some School Report graphics you can use on your dedicated web page. However, they can only be used by schools who have completed their paperwork, and within the context of the project.
It is also a good idea to incorporate the design of your school website to create a uniform look.
It is best to avoid a design which relies on large pictures as it will make pages slow to download and could put off potential viewers. However, you might like to add photographs of students taking part in School Report or the school logo.
Our agreement with the head teacher of every school taking part explicitly states that the school, not the BBC, is responsible for the school website. Teachers need to decide on the most suitable way of hosting content according to their school's social media, internet safety and child protection policies.
For this reason, we are happy to link to school websites which use YouTube (or similar video-sharing websites) to embed content, provided the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways. We will not, however, link directly to YouTube.
Some schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.
Providing the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways, we are happy to link to school websites containing links to social media.
Generally though, we do not recommend including links to social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter from your school website, as they are designed to be used by children aged 13 or over. There is a risk of students experiencing cyberbullying via such sites.
If your school website contains an automated Twitter feed, you may want to look into deactivating it or at least monitoring it during the busy time around News Day.
A dedicated page means the audience can find students' work easily and quickly. It also provides a  permanent archive of students' reports and makes it clear that the reports are new and not from previous years. The page can also help avoid any potential child protection issues.

30346384,"But that requires a very patient man or woman to select the most important periods of play.
Now scientists in Spain are trying to make that work easier by getting a computer to do it.
The technology is being designed to automatically edit a whole game down to the key moments.
The people behind it at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have been working on it for a few years and have just published 18 pages of exactly how it works.
Arnau Raventos is the lead professor on the project.
He tells Newsbeat they have ""been working with the local television companies in Spain in order to try to make the job easier for the person who manually does the summaries currently.""
Without having to read the full report (we did that for you) - in short - it analyses what are known as key-frames.
So, every part of the match is looked over by the computer to spot tell-tale signs of when something interesting is happening.
That might be lots of players grouped together, lots of zoomed-in action, extra noise from the crowd or the sound of the referee's whistle.
Arnau calls them ""occasions"".
""We want to find specific combinations of moments in a football match. A goal is an occasion.""
We thought of an example: if a defender goes down in the penalty box, everyone groups around them, you'll hear a whistle, there's lots of faces in the shot and a penalty happens. In theory, the technology should capture that.
There is a long way to go though.
The technology could frustrate even the most lukewarm of football fans because it hasn't quite nailed exactly the magic moment - when the goal goes in.
In a test on five matches, the technology detected 70 per cent of the total goals.
""We need to be sincere,"" says Arnau. ""We need to say that at the moment it's not possible to perform a complete automatic summary just yet. It's difficult to detect all the goals.""
""However, we think it's very easy to discard those moments that are not important. For example, the panoramic views. They are easy to detect and to discard them so that already makes the job of the editor easier.""

32713124,"The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list.
At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it.
Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating.
The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower.
The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS.
Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong.
Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard.
What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost.
Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation.
Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors.
It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome.
But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later.
The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny.
Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign.
The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile.
He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments.
The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition.
She has admitted the party failed to communicate what they were standing for. It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.",Another election is probably the last thing the public want to hear about after what we've just gone through but that's exactly what the parties at the assembly are gearing up for next year.,"The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list.","The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list.Image copyright Getty ImagesAt the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it.

36684452,"In a speech he said, given the effects of the referendum vote, the government had to be ""realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade"".
The target had been the chancellor's most prized goal and had been driving austerity measures in previous budgets.
But he said the economy is showing ""clear signs"" of shock following the vote to leave the European Union.
Giving a speech in Manchester, Mr Osborne said: ""The referendum is expected to produce a significant negative economic shock to our economy. How we respond will determine the impact on jobs and growth.
""We must provide fiscal credibility, continuing to be tough on the deficit while being realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade.""
Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move, saying: ""Sadly the vote last Thursday for Brexit has only brought forward what was inevitable.
""The Chancellor had already dropped his other fiscal rules on welfare and debt at the Budget in March, and according to many economists he was expected to be forced to drop this one too.""
BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed says that the target was heading for the ""Treasury shredding machine"" following a speech from Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday.
In a speech launching her bid to become prime minister she said ""we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament"".
Kamal says that Mr Osborne has now followed suit.
Nevertheless, the Treasury insists that it still wants to balance the books and ""fix the finances"".
Mr Osborne first committed himself to returning the national finances to surplus by 2020 at the Conservative Party conference in 2013 and it became policy in the July budget of 2015.
But there have been questions ever since over whether that target could be met.
Even before the referendum vote he only had ""a slightly better than 50/50 chance"" of making the target said Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
But the uncertainty caused by the Leave vote could hold back the economy and make creating a surplus even more difficult.
""Having voted for Brexit last week, the economy is clearly going to go into a downswing, that might be a full-blown recession, that might just be very very low growth,"" said Paul Johnson the director of the IFS.
It is sometimes easy in these incredible political times to forget that for most people ""it's the economy, stupid"" still holds true.
For the UK economy, one of the most important passages of Theresa May's speech yesterday was when she signalled that George Osborne's ""fiscal rule"" (to produce a budget surplus by 2020) was for the Treasury shredding machine.
""While it is absolutely vital that the government continues with its intention to reduce public spending and cut the budget deficit, we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament,"" Mrs May said.
Now the chancellor has said he agrees, arguing that the government must be ""realistic"" about its fiscal targets and that austerity policies could be eased.
My Treasury sources point out that the ""rule"" can be varied in ""non-normal"" times.
And these are pretty ""non-normal"" times.
The abandonment of the fiscal target suggests the government could borrow more, presumably for investment in infrastructure and to mitigate the need for tax rises and spending cuts, if the economy does take a turn for the worse as some predict.
More from Kamal: Brexit and the easing of austerity
The Tories have been in turmoil since David Cameron announced his intention to resign following the UK's vote in favour on leaving the European Union.
In a shock development on Thursday, Boris Johnson, widely seen as the frontrunner to become prime minister, announced that he would not be running.
The BBC has learned that Justice Secretary Michael Gove is now coming under growing pressure to abandon his bid to become Tory leader.
Sources have told the BBC government ministers are trying to persuade the justice secretary to give way so the party can ""unite"" around Home Secretary Theresa May.
Mr Gove opted to stand after switching his support from Boris Johnson.
In a speech, Mr Gove said his decision to stand to become Conservative leader is driven by ""conviction"" about what is right for the UK not personal ambition.
Three other candidates have put their names forward for the Conservative leadership: Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, MP Liam Fox and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb.
The government borrowed Â£74.9bn in the 2015/2016 fiscal year and for the financial year so far - covering April and May - borrowing reached Â£17.9bn, Â£0.2bn higher than the same period a year ago.
It is thought that the government will now raise borrowing, so it can avoid further cuts in spending or raising taxes. It could also borrow to invest in big building projects.
""The problem of course is, you can't borrow forever,""said Paul Johnson from the IFS.
""So we'll have a few more years of more borrowing, but my guess is this is not the end of austerity, actually this means austerity will just go on for longer because we'll probably have the spending cuts and tax rises right through the 2020s to pay for this.""",Chancellor George Osborne has abandoned his target to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020.,"In a speech he said, given the effects of the referendum vote, the government had to be ""realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade"".","In a speech he said, given the effects of the referendum vote, the government had to be ""realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade"".The target had been the chancellor's most prized goal and had been driving austerity measures in previous budgets.But he said the economy is showing ""clear signs"" of shock following the vote to leave the European Union.Giving a speech in Manchester, Mr Osborne said: ""The referendum is expected to produce a significant negative economic shock to our economy.

29455992,"The first of six boxes was unveiled on Tottenham Court Road this week.
The service is free to use although users will be shown adverts as they wait for their phone to charge.
Many of the UK's red telephone boxes have largely fallen into disuse although some are being revived as libraries or being fitted with medical equipment.
The boxes have had a makeover for the project - painted green and fitted with a roof-mounted 86cm solar panel.
Inside there are a variety of charging stations for different models of phone and a screen which shows adverts.
The advertising screen is reinforced to deter vandals and the boxes are maintained daily and locked overnight.
The project was the brainchild of two geography students turned entrepreneurs Harold Craston and Kirsty Kenny.
Both studied at the London School of Economics (LSE) and were interested in finding new ways to use public spaces.
""I lived next to a phone box in my second year at uni and walked past it every day. I thought, 'There are 8,000 of these lying unused in London and we must be able to find a use for them,'"" explained Mr Craston.
The solarbox can charge up to 100 phones a day, offering a 20% battery boost in 10 minutes.
Since launch, about six people per hour use the booth, according to the founder.
Running out of battery is a perennial problem for smartphone users as they become ever more powerful without an equivalent technology leap in battery life.
""On launch day, my phone ran out of battery and I genuinely had to use the box,"" said Mr Craston.
Solarbox won second place in the Mayor of London's Low Carbon Entrepreneur of the Year Award earlier this year and also won the LSE's Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year award.
Five more boxes will be rolled out by April 2015.

Human rights groups argue that there is no proper legal process for civilians, including children, who are detained by the army as part of their counter-insurgency operations.
""We fear that there are still kids who are being at least temporarily detained because they are being released from Boko Haram areas by the army but then kept for a while,"" Manuel Fontaine, regional director for the UN Children's fund (Unicef) in Central and West Africa, told Reuters news agency.
Earlier this month, 21 of the more than 200 Chibok schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram two years ago were released and reunited with their families.
Nigeria has been fighting a seven-year insurgency against Boko Haram, with the army retaking much of the territory under the Islamist militants' control in the past 20 months.

36189022,"Liberty, headed by Sanjeev Gupta, was first to express an interest in the assets when they were put up for sale.
A spokesman for Liberty told the BBC that the firm had put together a team of advisers and financial backers.
""The formal process is to submit a letter of intent; it amounts to a bid. It will be done on Tuesday,"" he said.
In addition to the Port Talbot factory - the UK's largest steelworks - Tata's remaining assets include sites at Newport, where more than 1,300 people are employed, and Rotherham, which employs 1,200. Tata also has operations at Corby, Shotton and Teesside.
Macquarie, the Australian bank, was advising Liberty on a potential bid, and is considered a potential financial backer of any takeover.
Liberty House started life in the university room of Indian-born founder Sanjeev Gupta.
While a student at Cambridge University in 1992, the budding entrepreneur started what has since become a global steel and commodities business with annual sales of more than £2bn.
With operations in 30 countries, and headquarters in London, Dubai, and Singapore, Mr Gupta's Liberty has also emerged as a possible saviour of Britain's steel industry.
Liberty's focus is on recycling the mountains of scrap metal generated in the UK, rather than the historical method of producing steel in blast furnaces.
Last month, it acquired Tata Steel's plants in Lanarkshire. In recent years, it has reached similar deals for steel plants in Newport and the Black Country.
A management buyout team is also planning to submit a bid under the name Excalibur Steel UK Limited.
It has appointed investment banker Mark Rhydderch-Roberts as a non-executive director. He joins Stuart Wilkie, the head of Tata's United Kingdom strip steel business, and former Alcan senior executive and venture capitalist Roger Maggs, on the board.
The government has promised to support any buyer of the business by taking up to a 25% stake in a new business and making hundreds of millions of pounds of finance available.
Tata has not publicly set a deadline for any deal, but has made it clear it cannot sustain its £1m-a-day losses indefinitely and does not want to prolong the uncertainty for workers and customers.
Tata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000 people, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1.","Liberty House plans to submit a formal bid on Tuesday to buy Tata Steel's UK assets, which include the Port Talbot works employing about 4,000 people.","Liberty, headed by Sanjeev Gupta, was first to express an interest in the assets when they were put up for sale.","Liberty, headed by Sanjeev Gupta, was first to express an interest in the assets when they were put up for sale.A spokesman for Liberty told the BBC that the firm had put together a team of advisers and financial backers.""The formal process is to submit a letter of intent; it amounts to a bid.

Other measures include legal protection for staff who admit mistakes, and new medical examiners to review deaths.
A patient safety charity welcomed the moves but said it remained ""concerned"".
The first annual ""learning from mistakes league"" uses feedback from staff on their freedom to speak when things go wrong.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is hosting a ""global patient safety summit"" in London on Wednesday and Thursday, said the changes were a step towards a ""new era of openness"".

39632041,"It is not the done thing to interfere in the internal affairs of a member state after all and Britain is still a member state - just about.
EU Council President Donald Tusk has already offered a lesson in what to say when you know you can't say much.
He wrote: ""It was Hitchcock who directed Brexit - first an earthquake and the tension rises.""
That suggests that Mr Tusk has only a hazy knowledge of the works of Hitchcock - but it also hints at an expectation in Brussels that the Brexit debate is about to heat up.
In domestic terms, Mrs May is hoping for a strong, clear and personal mandate to lead the Brexit negotiations on her own terms. And if the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wins he would also claim endorsement for placing his own political priorities at the centre of the talks to come.
But in European terms, that's something of a secondary issue.
The EU Commission's lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, is going to have to deal with whoever is in residence in 10 Downing Street and the strength of the occupant's mandate won't be his concern.
His team have already said that while the announcement doesn't change anything, there's a hope that it will produce a strong leader with strong backing from the people of the UK.
And we can be sure this British election will be watched with even closer attention than usual - not just in Brussels but in the other European capitals where Brexit is going to be a huge issue in the years to come.
First, both Theresa May and all her rivals will have to set out their visions for Brexit in much more detail than we've heard so far.
British voters will demand nothing less.
But in the process, the Barnier team and the governments of France, Germany and the rest will get a feeling for where the British red lines in negotiations really lie.
Any British candidate worth his or her salt will try to leave room for manoeuvre in the talks to come after the election, but it will surely be impossible to campaign without giving away at least some detail.
And of course there are romantics across Europe who hope that the voice of the Remainers will be heard loud and clear in the British debate to come.
The hope that Brexit might be quickly reversed has pretty much faded from the European debate now, but plenty of politicians across the continent will be hoping to hear candidates putting forward the argument for a soft Brexit with the closest possible links to the EU and its single market.
That may be wishful thinking, but there'll be strong support for such voices from many quarters in Europe.
Europe was taken by surprise by Theresa May's announcement, but not taken aback. The EU negotiators have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare their position and their message is that they're ready to negotiate with Britain, no matter who occupies 10 Downing Street.
This was already a busy year for European democracy - the Netherlands has already voted, while France votes for a president at the weekend and will hold National Assembly elections in June.
Germany goes to the polls in September.
But there's an awareness that the UK election will be different precisely because it will play a huge part in shaping the British negotiating position on Brexit.

29252950,"The official data prompted the government to upgrade growth forecasts for the second time in a week and to promise no new austerity measures.
Last week, growth for 2014 was up-rated to 3% from 2.1%, but will now be around 4.5%, Ireland's finance minister said.
Michael Noonan said the economy was in ""a catch-up phase... after recession"".
The year-on-year growth of 7.7% was the strongest recorded in Ireland since the early 2000s, Mr Noonan told reporters. By comparison, the eurozone recorded growth of just 0.7% over the same period.
Along with Greece, Spain and Portugal, Ireland was among the eurozone's worst hit economies, with the bursting of its property bubble and soaring unemployment.
The 1.5% quarterly rise beat the 0.5% expected by economists polled in a survey by the Reuters news agency.
Mr Noonan said the faster growth would mean Ireland's budget deficit falling to about 3.5% of GDP this year against a target of 4.8%. That meant 2bn euros of tax rises and spending cuts planned for next year would no longer be needed to reach the EU limit of 3% by the end of 2015, he said.
The economic improvement comes after years of austerity, a bailout from international lenders, and relentless austerity measures.
""At face value, the numbers suggest that the boom is back,"" said Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC Bank Ireland.
""It shows a clearly improving economy. It's very encouraging to see the improvement in consumption, in construction. So a domestic recovery is taking hold, if a lot less intense that the headline number would suggest,"" he said.","The Republic of Ireland's economy grew 1.5% in the second quarter of the year, figures show, and was up 7.7% on the April-to-June period in 2013.",The official data prompted the government to upgrade growth forecasts for the second time in a week and to promise no new austerity measures.,"The official data prompted the government to upgrade growth forecasts for the second time in a week and to promise no new austerity measures.Last week, growth for 2014 was up-rated to 3% from 2.1%, but will now be around 4.5%, Ireland's finance minister said.Mr Michael Noonan said the economy was in ""a catch-up phase... after recession"".The year-on-year growth of 7.7% was the strongest recorded in Ireland since the early 2000s, Mr Noonan told reporters.

20738732,"They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school.
Police officers have said he may have had a personality or developmental disorder, while one relative told ABC News he was ""obviously not well"".
Lanza appears to have kept a low profile throughout his life. US media report that unusually, his high school yearbook of 2010 contained no photograph of him.
""Camera shy"" was the comment by his entry.
Unlike the majority of his peers, Lanza apparently had no Facebook page. His online footprint was minimal. He appears not to have been known to the police.
Adam Lanza lived with his mother in a well-to-do neighbourhood of Newtown, Connecticut. The house is about five miles (8km) from Sandy Hook School, which he attended as a child.
He went on to Newtown High School, but made few friends. His mother pulled him out of the school and taught him at home because she was unhappy with the school district's plan for his education.
His aunt, Marsha Lanza, said that Adam was ""definitely the challenge to the family in that house"".
""Every family has one. I have one. They have one. â€¦ But he was a very bright boy, he was smart,"" she said.
Intelligent but shy and nervous were the most common memories of those who learnt beside him.
Richard Novia, who was head of security at Newtown High School, said it was clear Lanza had ""some disabilities"".
He was protective of his personal space and sometimes appeared to completely withdraw into himself or to ""take flight"", Mr Novia told AP, meaning his mother had to be called in to resolve the problem.
""You had yourself a very scared young boy, who was very nervous around people he could trust or he refused to speak with.""
Mr Novia helped to run a technology club, which Lanza attended, and said he had to keep a close eye on him while the club was using soldering equipment or electrical equipment.
""If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically,"" he said.
An inability to respond to sensation, and a difficult in relating to other people, could be an indication of Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism), say experts.
They stress there is no direct link between the condition and aggression. People with the condition can sometimes struggle to express themselves in socially expected ways, however.
Olivia DeVivo was a student with Lanza in the 10th grade, at about the age of 15. She told the Associated Press he was ""very shy and didn't make an effort to interact with anybody"".
""Now looking back, it's kind of like 'OK, he had all these signs,' but you can't say every shy person would do something like this,"" she said.
A former school bus driver in the town, Marsha Moskowitz, said she remembered the Lanza boys.
""You know the trouble kids, and you figure, 'Pfft, that one's going to be trouble.' But I never would have thought that about them,"" she told the Hartford Courant newspaper.
Marsha Lanza told the Associated Press that Adam had been raised by kind, nurturing parents, who would not have hesitated to seek counselling for their son if he needed it.
The parents divorced in 2009, having separated at least three years earlier. His father, Peter Lanza, moved to Stamford, Connecticut, and recently remarried.
His mother, Nancy, remained in the family home, where it is thought she was killed by her son. She had previously worked in finance, but her divorce settlement left her well off and she stayed at home.
Friends said she was popular and sociable. An acquaintance, Jim Leff, wrote on his blog that she was ""a friend-of-friends who I periodically would briefly bump into, and who always seemed kind-hearted... and, yes, a bit high-strung. But with ample reason, as it turns out.""
Contrary to initial reports, Nancy Lanza never worked as a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
She was a gun enthusiast who is reported to have taken her sons with her to the shooting range. Adam Lanza used her legally purchased Bushmaster assault rifle to carry out his attack. He was also carrying his mother's two handguns, a Glock pistol and a Sig Sauer. Police found a shotgun in his car.
Adam Lanza's elder brother, 24-year-old Ryan, who was initially named in the media as the suspected gunman, has been helping police with their investigation. US media is reporting that he told them he had had no contact with his brother since 2010.
In a statement issued to the media, Lanza's father said: ""No words can truly express how heartbroken we are.
""We, too, are asking why. Like so many of you, we are saddened and struggling to make sense of what has transpired.""","Former classmates of Adam Lanza, 20, the man identified as the gunman in the Sandy Hook School killings, do not remember much about him.","They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school.","They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school.Police officers have said he may have had a personality or developmental disorder, while one relative told ABC News he was ""obviously not well"".Lanza appears to have kept a low profile throughout his life.

35659406,"Giving evidence for the ex-Sunderland winger at Bradford Crown Court, Stacey Flounders said she did not see a future in their relationship.
The 26-year-old is the mother of Mr Johnson's one-year-old daughter.
Mr Johnson, 28, denies two counts of sexual activity with a child.
In the witness box, Miss Flounders described how he had told her ""everything"" about kissing a 15-year-old girl when he returned from a police station after his arrest in March last year.
Asked if he talked about other things, she said: ""The other women that he cheated on me with.""
Miss Flounders was asked by Orlando Pownall QC, defending, how many there were and she said: ""Quite a few.""
When questioned about about the future of her relationship with Mr Johnson, she replied: ""We're just going to remain friends.""
She told the jury she had stayed with him after his arrest ""because he was honest with me and I knew he was telling the truth"".
""We'd just had a daughter. I wanted us to be a family. My head was all over the place. I didn't know what was going on.""
Mr Pownall finished his questions by asking Miss Flounders if she saw any future in ""the relationship that you had"".
She replied: ""Do you mean now? Not at the minute, I don't. No.""
She was asked about messages she exchanged with Mr Johnson on the day of the incident with the girl, and she admitted she suspected him of being unfaithful but had no ""hard and fast evidence"".
She said he first told her he was going to plead guilty around September last year.
Miss Flounders said she had previously exchanged messages with the teenager involved after she recognised her as one of the fans who waited for Mr Johnson after home matches.
She said she even wished the girl happy birthday in 2014.
She added that after his arrest, Mr Johnson told her the girl was aged 16.
Kate Blackwell, QC, prosecuting, went through some of the details of the teenager's account of the incident and asked Miss Flounders whether her partner had told her about each.
Miss Blackwell asked her if he told her the pair had kissed with tongues and about various messages Mr Johnson had exchanged with the girl.
Miss Flounders agreed that he had not told her, although she said he had mentioned he asked for a ""thank you kiss"".
Earlier, Miss Flounders was asked a series of questions about her partner's pubic hair and was asked to examine a photograph.
The teenager involved in the incident has told the jury Mr Johnson was shaved in that area.
Miss Flounders said he would trim the area with scissors, but would not shave.
Mr Johnson began his football career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then on to Sunderland in 2012.
He has previously pleaded guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming.  These relate to him kissing the girl in his Range Rover after exchanging messages with her on social media.

39378077,"It comes after a bidder to run University Hospital of Hartlepool's fertility services was rejected, despite already running services there.
Hartlepool Borough's council asked the area's clinical commissioning group (CCG) to explore with the bidder how it could reach the required standard.
But, the CCG said it could not lawfully treat one bidder differently.
Care Fertility, which operates 15 clinics across Britain and supports fertility services in Hartlepool, said in January it was ""disappointed not to be awarded the contract"".
The council's audit and governance committee asked the CCG to discuss with the firm how it could reduce risks highlighted in its rejected tender.
The CCG said this was not ""reasonably practicable"".
""It is simply not the role of the CCG to guide bidders to make successful tenders,"" it said.
It would be an ""unusual and unwelcome"" precedent for the CCG to advise bidders and would lead to accusations of unfairness if it did not do the same for all other bidders in the future, it said.
It also said re-tendering would take too long, could increase clinical risk and prolong the gap in the delivery of the service and there was ""no guarantee that the outcome would be any different"".
Last year, the council was granted a High Court injunction to stop the unit's closure, after which it was announced an alternative provider would be sought to run fertility services, including IVF.

36163760,"There have been ongoing industrial problems in the school for months.
The panel consists of leading educationalist Prof Sir Robert Salisbury, trade unionist John Corey and Belfast Metropolitan College's principal Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se McGivern.
Education Minister John O'Dowd has said he wants them to complete the investigation by early summer.
The secondary school, in the Andersonstown area of west Belfast, has 1,100 pupils.
About a third of its 70-strong teaching staff were absent for a period prior to Easter, and, in an unusual move last month, an associate principal was appointed to the school.
A group representing some parents also held a number of protests to express their concern about how the disputes were affecting their children.
Mr O'Dowd said that he wanted the panel to investigate events in the school, and make recommendations ""to ensure the school's future"".
""I consider the panel members to be eminently well qualified and experienced,"" he said.
""My priority continues to be to the pupils at the school and this investigation will give pupils, parents, staff and their representatives, and all those involved with the governance of the school, the opportunity to express their view.""
The investigation will look at staff relationships, the role of senior leadership, governance of the school and the impact of the ongoing disputes on pupils.
Mr Corey was general secretary of Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) union from 2003-10 and is currently a member of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.
Prior to her role at Belfast Metropolitan College, Ms McGivern was director of development at Belfast City Council.
Sir Robert, meanwhile, recently chaired the literacy and numeracy task force in Northern Ireland and is a former professor of education at the University of Nottingham.
The National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), which represents almost half the teachers at De La Salle College, welcomed the appointments.
It said the move ""should reassure all partners in the De La Salle community that Minister O'Dowd is committed to finding a robust resolution to the recent period of challenge"".
However, it said the terms of reference would be ""critical to the success or otherwise of the investigation"".
The NASUWT also said it will ""seek assurances from the panel that their work will not cause any further disruption"".
Jim Clarke, chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS), also welcomed the appointment of the panel.
""The background and experience of those who will be carrying out the investigation gives confidence to the process,"" he said.
""CCMS will continue with its ongoing work with the other interests through the agreed strategy. It remains focused on the needs and interests of the pupils at the school.""",A three-person panel has been appointed to carry out an investigation into De La Salle College in west Belfast.,There have been ongoing industrial problems in the school for months.,"There have been ongoing industrial problems in the school for months.The panel consists of leading educationalist Prof Sir Robert Salisbury, trade unionist John Corey and Belfast Metropolitan College's principal Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se McGivern.Image copyright PA Image caption The panel was appointed by the Education MinisterEducation Minister John O'Dowd has said he wants them to complete the investigation by early summer.The secondary school, in the Andersonstown area of west Belfast, has 1,100 pupils.About a third of its 70-strong teaching staff were absent for a period prior to Easter, and, in an unusual move last month, an associate principal was appointed to the school.A number of parents also held a number of protests to express their concern about how the disputes were affecting their children.The school has been closed since Easter.Image caption The school has a large number of pupilsMr O' Dowd said that he wanted the panel to investigate events in the School, and make recommendations ""to ensure the school's future"".""I consider the panel members to be eminently well qualified and experienced,"" he said.""My priority continues to be to the pupils at the school and to the wider community.""Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr O"
27786442,"The Bulls' fate has been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead.
Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South.
""Hereford United can have no complaints. The Conference bent over backwards to help them.
""I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking.
""It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves.
""You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.""
The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June.
The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000.
That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June.
But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted.
The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010.
They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up.
By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane.
26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season
29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for £1 and clear their £220,000 debts
22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too
2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice
3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner
5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote
6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June
10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference
And former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.
When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000.
They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
An offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street.
But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option.
Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover.
The downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates.
The average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.",Hereford United have been expelled from the Football Conference following the club's failure to pay their bills.,The Bulls' fate has been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead.,"The Bulls' fate has been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead.""Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South.""Hereford United can have no complaints.

39586912,"His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it. The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.
A few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.
Carrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.
Eyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.
Faizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.
""I knew he was gone,"" Zarifa told me.
A heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.
Faizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest ""martyr"". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.
Faizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.
The voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.
The soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with ""protests and provocation"" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.
One report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.
Separatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the ""anti-people"" agenda of the Indian government.
Disillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.
Why Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.
By all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.
Whatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.
A picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - ""he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,"" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.
""He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,"" a cousin told me, when I visited the family.
Grief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.
""My son, my son, where will I find you now?"" she cried, again and again.
Then she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.
""The blood of a martyr never goes waste,"" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. ""One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].""
A brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy.
""I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.""
Outside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.
They said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because ""they are our brothers and don't kill civilians"" and are ""fighting for freedom"".
More than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.
""We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,"" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.
Since February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.
The army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.
Recently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.
""Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,"" an army officer told me.
The region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.
Kashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.
Many say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.
Militancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.
But young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of ""becoming irrelevant"", as a leader of an opposition party told me.
""This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,"" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher.
""India needs to be worried, very worried about this.""","The day 12-year-old Faizan Fayaz Dar died, he woke up in the morning in his hilltop home in Budgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, had a cup of salted tea, recited the Koran and pottered around in the kitchen where his mother prepared breakfast for the family.","His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it.","His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it.

33551522,"Neil Trotter admitted taking pictures of women at Edinburgh's Waverley Station and Glasgow's Buchanan Galleries between June and September 2014.
A sheriff told the 54-year-old, from Falkirk, that ""women should be able to walk without fear"" in public places.
He was also placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years.
A previous hearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told that Trotter travelled into Edinburgh daily by train to go to work.
On Monday 29 September, a fellow passenger noted him walking in ""a curious, a sinister manner"" at Waverley Station, ""clearly making an effort to get very close to a female ahead of him"" on the escalator.
Fiscal depute Aidan Higgins, prosecuting, told the court that ""it was clear he was using his phone to get under the lady's skirt, taking photographs"".
The commuter reported his concerns to British Transport Police and Trotter was identified from CCTV footage. He was detained as he left the station the following day.
Examination of Trotter's phone and his home computer established that he had been using his mobile on various days between 11 June and 29 September, with 22 videos showing the camera had been directed under women's skirts.
Defence solicitor Neil Hay told the court Trotter was ""most ashamed of his actions"", and ""well aware his behaviour is unacceptable"".
He said his client had ""lost his career, brought his family to the brink of financial ruin and brought shame and humiliation to himself and those very close to him"".
Sentencing him to 18 months in prison, Sheriff Peter Braid told Trotter: ""You have pled guilty to taking images of women in a clandestine manner, prompted by voyeuristic impulses for your own sexual gratification.
""This involved significant planning committed over a period of more than three months in public places where women should be able to walk without fear.
""The repugnance society must feel towards these offences is such that, in my view, there is no alternative to a custodial sentence, in retribution and to deter others.""",A former senior information officer for the Scottish government has been jailed for 18 months for using his mobile phone to take photos up women's skirts.,Neil Trotter admitted taking pictures of women at Edinburgh's Waverley Station and Glasgow's Buchanan Galleries between June and September 2014.,"Neil Trotter admitted taking pictures of women at Edinburgh's Waverley Station and Glasgow's Buchanan Galleries between June and September 2014.Image copyright PAA sheriff told the 54-year-old, from Falkirk, that ""women should be able to walk without fear"" in public places.He was also placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years.A previous hearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told that Trottter travelled into Edinburgh daily by train to go to work.On Monday 29 September, a fellow passenger noted him walking in ""a curious, a sinister manner"" at Waverly Station, ""clearly making an effort to get very close to a female ahead of him"" on the escalator.Trotter was arrested at the station the following day.Fiscal depute Aidan Higgins, prosecuting, told the court that ""it was clear he was using his phone to get under the lady's skirt, taking photographs"".He added: ""It was a very disturbing and disturbing experience for the female passenger.""The commuter reported his concerns to British Transport Police and Trotters was identified from CCTV footage.

32288286,"Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson endorsed her party's UK manifesto.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the Conservatives were ""talking up"" the SNP's prospects.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was in New Lanark, while Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy was on the campaign trail in Cumbernauld.
Speaking at the Dawnfresh fish factory in Uddingston, Ms Davdison believed that a Labour government propped up by the SNP would be damaging for the UK's finances.
She said that under a Conservative government minimum wage earners would pay no income tax.
Ms Davidson added: ""We're the party which will sort out the economy so that we can afford a great NHS and give you and your family the chance to make the most of your lives.
""The SNP and Labour have the brass neck to pretend that they have a plan for the economy but any plan based on more taxes, more borrowing and more debt would wreck all the hard work of the last five years.""
However, Mr Rennie, who was campaigning in Pittenweem, said the Conservatives, were ""putting their party before their country by seeking to increase their vote share at any price"".
He added: ""The Conservative election campaign has repeatedly talked up the SNP. Immediately after the UK leaders debates, George Osborne was talking up the performance of Nicola Sturgeon.
""I am not sure what kind of bizarre tactical game he was playing but it can only have helped the SNP increase their support further.
""And now the Conservatives in Scotland are getting in the way of our battles to stop the SNP in the 11 Westminster seats we hold in Scotland.""

Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Ms Sturgeon attacked both the Tories and Labour as she continued election campaigning.
She said: ""People in Scotland have always known to expect harsh, ideological cuts from the Tories - and today's cuts manifesto is likely to be more of the same. But that Labour have been so quick to meekly fall into line with George Osborne's plans just goes to show how far they have moved away from their roots.
""And with Ed Balls lifting the lid on Labour's cuts plans yesterday and finally putting an end to Jim Murphy's anti-cuts pretence, Labour's commitment to austerity is clear for all to see.""
The SNP leader and first minister of Scotland had earlier taken questions from listeners on BBC Radio's Five Live morning phone in.
In response to a question from presenter Nicky Campbell, Ms Sturgeon reiterated that she was not planning another independence referendum. She said that if you voted SNP on 7 May, you were not voting for another referendum.
In Cumbernauld, Mr Murphy said SNP plans for Scottish taxes supporting Scotland's finances would mean millions lost for working families in tax credits.
Mr Murphy said: ""The SNP's reckless plans will cost working families the most, with a £7.6bn black hole in Scotland's finances and the end of the UK welfare state as we know it.
""Scotland doesn't have to choose between Tory austerity or SNP austerity max. Scottish Labour is the only party on the ballot paper offering a real alternative to austerity.
""Only Labour is big enough and strong enough to kick the Tories out and give working families the support they need.""
Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens backed the manifesto commitments of the Green Party of England and Wales which they believe would make a positive difference to people's lives.
Alison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens said: ""Greens across these islands are clear: we must end Westminster's failed austerity experiment.""
Voters throughout the UK go to the polls on 7 May to choose their next MP.

33450881,"Perry Beeches III is one of a chain of six free schools. Mr Cameron described the schools as ""a real success story"".
But the Ofsted report said too many students were underachieving and described teaching as ""inadequate"".
Perry Beeches chief executive Liam Nolan said he ""fundamentally disagreed"" with the inspectors.
The school's headteacher, Darren Foreman, its senior leadership team and chair of governors have resigned, Mr Nolan said.
Mr Nolan has taken on the role of interim head teacher, together with Jackie Powell.
The report said: ""Teaching is inadequate. Too much is dull and fails to engage students who became bored and start to fidget.""
It also accused the school's leadership of having an, ""unrealistic and inaccurate"" view of the school and added students' behaviour required improvement.
Mr Nolan said: ""This judgement makes me question Ofsted's credibility.""
However he said he intended to work with Ofsted to make the school outstanding.
He described the report as an, ""unfortunate blip"".
He said: ""Within six months you will see us back on the top.""
The Perry Beeches schools are funded by central government but not run by local authorities.
Two of the other schools in the chain have been rated ""outstanding"" by Ofsted.
Perry Beeches III was opened by the Prime Minister in September 2013.
At the time, he said the majority of free schools were, ""a real success story we should build on as a country"".
A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Liam Nolan and the Perry Beeches free schools are transforming the life chances of children in Birmingham, in some of the most deprived communities of the country.
""The performance of Perry Beeches I and II has set the bar for schools across the rest of the country.

38672009,"Oxfordshire County Council said two independent studies found having one organisation to run all services could save £100m over five years.
But the plan is opposed by the county's five district councils, who have argued in favour of three councils instead.
All the authorities have been criticised for engaging in a ""turf war"" over their rival devolution plans.
County council leader Ian Hudspeth said public money should be spent on providing services, rather than running ""six separate organisations"".
The district councils have argued the county needs an elected mayor, rather than fewer councillors, to get more money from Whitehall.
Oxford City Council leader Bob Price said the county's plan was ""the wrong proposal at the wrong time"".
He added: ""For the people of Oxford, a unitary council would be a disaster.
""The needs of a multi-ethnic and socially mixed urban community are very different to the more rural parts of the county.""
Leader of West Oxfordshire District Council James Mills said the aim of the district councils' devolution bid was to get more money from central government.
He said: ""A mayor gives a strong voice to Oxford, single point of contact to government and is accountable to the people of Oxfordshire.""
But Mr Hudspeth said the proposal was needed because the county council ""cannot continue to make savings without further cuts to local services"".
He said: ""One council for Oxfordshire would be more efficient and simpler for residents, with one phone number, one website and one point of contact.""

It also lets the handhelds act as controllers for the firm's Internet Explorer web browser, which will launch on the console later this year.
The move poses a challenge to Nintendo's Wii U Game Pad.
While the Japanese company's product is specifically designed to enhance the experience of using its next-generation console, Microsoft is offering users a way to extend the functionality of its existing games machines via third-party devices they may already have.
""Xbox SmartGlass works with all the devices that you already own: the TV you already own, the phone you already own and the tablet you already own,"" said Marc Whitten, head of Microsoft's Xbox Live division.
""Xbox SmartGlass turns any TV into a smart TV.""
A demo showed the highly anticipated first-person shooter Halo 4 using the facility to trigger maps and other data about its in-game environment.
The announcement
 was made in Microsoft's keynote presentation at the E3 video games trade show in Los Angeles.
Mr Whitten added that SmartGlass would also enhance television programmes and films streamed through the Xbox.
He gave the example of a viewer watching Game of Thrones on their television and being able to look down at their tablets to see where on-screen characters were located on a map of the show's fantasy world.
The demonstration also showed how the linked device could bring up details about the cast and characters while the user was watching a film.
""It lets Microsoft say that you don't need to buy new hardware to have a two-screen experience,"" Stephen Totilo, editor of gaming website Kotaku, told the BBC.
""Nintendo looked to be ahead of everyone else on this, but now Microsoft is breathing down its neck. But there may be a little bit of smoke and mirrors here as I'm not convinced SmartGlass will have as much functionality as the Wii U offers.""
The app was also mocked by South Park's creator Trey Parker who was at the event to promote a new video game featuring his characters.
""How many times have you been watching an episode of South Park and thought I'd like to be able to watch this on my television while hooked into my mobile device which is being controlled by my tablet device which is hooked into my oven all while sitting in the refrigerator,"" he joked.
New uses for Microsoft's Kinect motion and voice sensor also featured heavily in the E3 presentation.
A tie-up with Nike
 will deliver a title towards the end of the year in which a digital personal trainer offers feedback on owners' workout techniques based on information gathered by the Kinect.
Voice commands were shown being used to change team formations in the next edition of the American Football simulation John Madden NFL, and to call in air strikes in the action game Splinter Cell Blacklist.
A new game called Wrecketer also allows players to use gestures to launch and guide missiles to destroy castles in a title based around a similar concept to Angry Birds.
Microsoft also promoted its device as an entertainment hub.
A new service called Xbox Music will offer ""over 30 million music tracks"" to the Xbox as well as Windows 8 and Windows Phone devices.
A video suggested the service would rival similar offerings from Spotify, Rdio and others. However, details were scant with no launch date or countries mentioned, and no comment about how it would affect the firm's existing Zune product.
US users were promised new content including NBA basketball games, Paramount Pictures movies and Nickelodeon children's programmes.
Much of the rest of the presentation was dedicated to trailers showcasing new titles in existing video game franchises such as Tomb Raider, Fable, Call of Duty and Resident Evil.
""We're probably getting a new Xbox console in 2013 so that will be what the next E3 is about, so they had to spend this year talking about the stuff that precedes it,"" said Mr Totilo.
""But people who get upset about sequels forget they tend to be some of the best games ever made as developers don't have to worry about working with new hardware, and can instead hone their craft and be creative.""",Microsoft has unveiled Xbox SmartGlass: a service to allow tablet computers and smartphones to communicate with its video games consoles.,It allows users to control games on the touchscreen devices and can show extra information about progress.,"It allows users to control games on the touchscreen devices and can show extra information about progress.It also lets the handhelds act as controllers for the firm's Internet Explorer web browser, which will launch on the console later this year.The move poses a challenge to Nintendo's Wii U Game Pad.

As well as any home replays being played at a venue in England at Guernsey's expense, the club would also have to play any postponed home ties in England as well.
A Channel Island team has competed in an FA Cup before. Jersey's St Peter's ladies side played in the 2004 FA Women's Cup, losing 3-1 to Aldershot Town in the first qualifying round.
The FA has given Guernsey until Monday, 24 June to decide if they want to enter on those terms, and told BBC South West Sport that they would not comment until that time.
""They haven't given a reason, they've just set out these conditions,"" Braybrook said.
""I can only imagine their concern is that opposing clubs would have to travel over midweek, and at a lower level some of the players will have to work and they may have concerns about that.
""We would love to be in the competition but it's purely finance.
